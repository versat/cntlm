# Cntlm Authentication Proxy Configuration
#
# NOTE: No URL escape encoding is needed. For example, 123@xyz is
# parsed literally, do NOT use 123%40xyz where %40 is the encoding
# of @. In case the password contains special characters like
# spaces, pound signs, etc, it should be enclosed in double quotes.
# For examples, 123#xyz should be "123#xyz".
# Use 0600 perms if you use plaintext password and see cntlm(1) man
# page for more details.
#

# Username	testuser
# Domain		corp-uk
# Password	password
# NOTE: Use plaintext password only at your own risk
# Use hashes instead. You can use a "cntlm -M" and "cntlm -H"
# command sequence to get the right config for your environment.
# See cntlm man page
# Example secure config shown below.
# PassLM          1AD35398BE6565DDB5C4EF70C0593492
# PassNT          77B9081511704EE852F94227CF48A793
### Only for user 'testuser', domain 'corp-uk'

# Specify the netbios hostname cntlm will send to the parent
# proxies. Normally the value is auto-guessed.
#
# Workstation	netbios_hostname

# List of parent proxies to use. More proxies can be defined
# one per line in format <proxy_ip>:<proxy_port>
#
Proxy		10.0.0.41:8080
Proxy		10.0.0.42:8080

# List addresses you do not want to pass to parent proxies
# * and ? wildcards can be used
#
NoProxy		localhost, 127.0.0.*, 10.*, 192.168.*

# Use a proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file to determine the parent
# proxy based on the request's target host/URL.
# Specify the PAC file path. Two usage modes are supported:
#  - Local file: a filesystem path (e.g. /etc/proxy.pac). The PAC will be
#    resolved and parsed immediately at startup. If the file cannot be read
#    or parsed, cntlm will exit with an error.
#  - Remote URL: an HTTP URL (e.g. http://example.com/proxy.pac). The PAC
#    will be fetched lazily on the first incoming connection to avoid
#    blocking startup on network access. Only http:// (not https://) is
#    supported for remote PAC fetching. After a successful fetch and parse
#    the PAC is used for proxy selection. Fetch or parse failures are logged
#    and may cause termination depending on configuration.
#
# Examples:
#Pac /etc/proxy.pac
#Pac http://intra.example.com/proxy.pac

# Specify the port cntlm will listen on
# You can bind cntlm to specific interface by specifying
# the appropriate IP address also in format <local_ip>:<local_port>
# Cntlm listens on 127.0.0.1:3128 by default
#
Listen		3128

# If you wish to use the SOCKS5 proxy feature as well, uncomment
# the following option. It can be used several times
# to have SOCKS5 on more than one port or on different network
# interfaces (specify explicit source address for that).
#
# WARNING: The service accepts all requests, unless you use
# SOCKS5User and make authentication mandatory. SOCKS5User
# can be used repeatedly for a whole bunch of individual accounts.
#
#SOCKS5Proxy	8010
#SOCKS5User	dave:password

# Use -M first to detect the best NTLM settings for your proxy.
# Default is to use the only secure hash, NTLMv2, but it is not
# as available as the older stuff.
#
# This example is the most universal setup known to man, but it
# uses the weakest hash ever. I won't have it's usage on my
# conscience. :) Really, try -M first.
